### Introduction:

The Digital Transformation Potential Indicator (DTPI) is a strategic initiative by the **Business and Digital Transformation Club @ GSoM POLIMI**, aimed at providing **data-driven insights** into the state of digitalization across the European Union (EU). The index offers an up-to-date pulse check on the **digitalization status and potential** of individual EU countries, as well as the EU as a whole. By updating this index **quarterly**, we aim to track shifts in digitalization trends, informing decision-makers and stakeholders about emerging opportunities and challenges in the digital landscape.

### Purpose:

In today's rapidly evolving digital environment, **businesses, policymakers, and researchers** require timely and reliable insights into the factors driving digital transformation. The DTPI serves this need by providing a **composite measure** that integrates multiple indicators related to **economic value creation through digital investments**. Our goal is to offer a dynamic tool that can monitor and assess how effectively digital investments are fostering economic growth and innovation across Europe.

### What is a Composite Index?

A **composite index** is a statistical tool that combines multiple individual indicators into a single score. Each indicator reflects a specific aspect of the subject being measured, and together they offer a more **holistic view** than individual metrics alone. Composite indices are commonly used to capture complex, multi-dimensional phenomena—like digital transformation—by aggregating different factors into a single, interpretable score.

The **DTPI** is such a composite index. It synthesizes three critical components—**Gross Value Added (GVA)** in the ICT sector, **labor demand**, and **employment rates**—to provide a comprehensive view of the **digital economy's potential** in each country.

### Overview of the DTPI

The **DTPI** tracks and measures the potential impact of **digital investments** on a country's **economic growth and innovation**. By focusing on the **ICT sector**, the DTPI can gauge the role of technology in boosting productivity, increasing employment, and driving overall economic value. Updated quarterly, this index allows for real-time tracking of digitalization trends across the EU.

### Who Can Use the DTPI?

The DTPI is a versatile tool designed to serve a range of stakeholders:

- **Policymakers**: To assess the effectiveness of digital investments and identify policy areas that need attention to further stimulate digital growth.
- **Businesses**: To gauge the digital maturity of their operating environment and uncover opportunities for **innovation and expansion**.

### Components of the DTPI

1. **Gross Value Added (GVA) in the ICT Sector**: This reflects the **direct economic contribution** of the ICT sector to a country's economy. A higher GVA indicates that the sector is contributing significantly to national economic growth.
   
2. **Labor Demand in ICT**: This component measures the **demand for ICT skills** across different sectors, highlighting the extent to which digital technologies are being adopted.

3. **Employment Rate in ICT**: This tracks the **employment level** within ICT-related occupations, offering insights into how digital transformation is impacting the job market.

### How to Read the Index

The DTPI score provides an easy-to-understand snapshot of a country's digital transformation potential:

- **Low DTPI Score**: Indicates a **lower level of digitalization** in terms of economic contribution, demand for digital skills, and ICT employment. Countries with lower scores may have untapped potential for digital growth.
  
- **Mid-range DTPI Score**: Suggests that a country is experiencing **moderate digital growth**, where the ICT sector is becoming more integral to economic activities, and demand for ICT expertise is steadily rising.

- **High DTPI Score**: Represents **strong digitalization** where the ICT sector plays a pivotal role in the economy, demand for ICT skills is high, and employment in digital occupations is thriving.

### Examples of DTPI Scores:

- **Low Score Example (0.3)**: A country like **Country A**, which may have a nascent ICT sector, limited demand for digital skills, and low ICT employment. There’s significant potential for growth if digital investments are increased.

- **Mid-range Score Example (0.5)**: A country like **Country B** might have a moderate GVA from ICT, a steadily rising demand for digital skills, and employment growth in the sector. The country is progressing, but there is room for further digital integration.

- **High Score Example (0.7)**: A country like **Country C** could have a well-developed ICT sector contributing a large portion to the economy, high demand for digital skills, and strong employment in ICT-related occupations. This country leads in digital transformation and reaps economic benefits.
