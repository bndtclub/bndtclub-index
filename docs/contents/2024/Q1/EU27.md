**Potential Factors Influencing Trends**

- **External factors**:
  Several external factors likely influenced the declining trend in the DTPI. The ongoing global economic uncertainty due to post-pandemic recovery challenges, supply chain disruptions, and energy market volatility in Europe may have slowed down investment in digital infrastructure and technological innovations, which are key drivers of digital transformation.

- **Internal factors**:
  Internally, structural barriers within the EU27, such as regional disparities in digital infrastructure and skills gaps in key ICT sectors, may have contributed to the decrease in DTPI. Additionally, policy shifts or delays in implementing digital transformation strategies at the national and EU levels could have slowed the pace of growth, particularly in smaller and less developed member states.
