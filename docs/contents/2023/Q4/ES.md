**Potential Factors Influencing Trends**

- **External factors**. The rebound in Spain’s DTPI could be attributed to improved economic conditions across Europe, coupled with increased digital investment from both the public and private sectors.

Policy initiatives aimed at accelerating digital transformation in key sectors, such as healthcare and education, may have also played a significant role in driving this growth by the end of 2024.
