The box plots below illustrate the range and distribution of the **Digital Transformation Potential Indicator (DTPI)** scores for each country across different quarters. Each plot shows the minimum, maximum, and median values, with the box representing the interquartile range (the middle 50% of the data). These visualizations allow you to quickly compare the variability in DTPI scores between countries, highlighting both the consistency and fluctuations in their digital transformation potential over time.

Below the box plots, on the left-hand side, you can see the DTPI for **EU27**, while the right-hand side presents the indicator for the **selected countries** you have chosen for comparison.
