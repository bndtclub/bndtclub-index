## Introduction

The Digital Transformation Potential Indicator (DTPI) is a strategic initiative by the [Business and Digital Transformation Club at GSoM POLIMI](https://bit.ly/bndtclub), aimed at providing **data-driven insights** into the state of digitalization across the European Union (EU). The index offers an up-to-date pulse check on the **digitalization status and potential** of individual EU countries, as well as the EU as a whole. By updating this index **quarterly**, we aim to track shifts in digitalization trends, informing decision-makers and stakeholders about emerging opportunities and challenges in the digital landscape.

### Purpose

In today's rapidly evolving digital environment, **businesses, policymakers, and researchers** require timely and reliable insights into the factors driving digital transformation. The DTPI serves this need by providing a **composite measure** that integrates multiple indicators related to **economic value creation through digital investments**. Its ultimate goal is to offer a dynamic tool that can monitor and assess how effectively digital investments are fostering economic growth and innovation across Europe.

### What is a Composite Index?

A **composite index** is a statistical tool that combines multiple individual indicators into a single score. Each indicator reflects a specific aspect of the subject being measured, and together they offer a more **holistic view** than individual metrics alone. Composite indices are commonly used to capture complex, multi-dimensional phenomena—like digital transformation—by aggregating different factors into a single, interpretable score.

The **DTPI** is such a composite index. It synthesizes three critical components—**Gross Value Added (GVA)** in the ICT sector, **labor demand**, and **employment rates**—to provide a comprehensive view of the **digital economy's potential** in each country.

### Overview of the DTPI

The **DTPI** tracks and measures the potential impact of **digital investments** on a country's **economic growth and innovation**. By focusing on the **ICT sector**, the DTPI can gauge the role of ICT technologies and investments in boosting productivity, increasing employment, and driving overall economic value. Updated quarterly, this index allows for real-time tracking of digitalization trends across the EU.

### Who Can Use the DTPI?

The DTPI is a versatile tool designed to serve a range of stakeholders:

- **Policymakers**. To assess the effectiveness of digital investments and identify policy areas that need attention to further stimulate digital growth.
- **Businesses**. To gauge the digital maturity of their operating environment and uncover opportunities for **innovation and expansion**.
- **Researchers**. To study the correlation between digital transformation and broader economic indicators, including GDP growth and employment.

### Components of the DTPI

1. **Gross Value Added (GVA) in the ICT Sector**. This reflects the **direct economic contribution** of the ICT sector to a country's economy. A higher GVA indicates that the sector is contributing significantly to national economic growth.
   
2. **Labor Demand (LD) in ICT**. This component measures the **demand for ICT skills** across different sectors, highlighting the extent to which digital technologies are being adopted.

3. **Employment Rate (LD) in ICT**. This tracks the **employment level** within ICT-related occupations, offering insights into how digital transformation is impacting the job market.

### EU27 and EU6

The DTPI provides the aggregate view for the EU27 and in addition to that a punctual zoom into a selected number of EU countries, namely the EU6 of the DTPI comprising of Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Netherlands.
