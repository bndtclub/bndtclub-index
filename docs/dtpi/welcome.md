## Welcome to the Digital Transformation Potential Index (DTPI) Beta!

The DTPI, developed by the [Business and Digital Transformation Club at GSoM POLIMI](https://bit.ly/bndtclub), is a platform that provides quarterly insights into the digitalization trends and pervasiveness across the European Union (EU), driven by the computation of the DTPI. It helps stakeholders like policymakers, businesses, and researchers understand the digital economy's current state and its potential if compared to the actual status of digitalisation.

The DTPI focusses on three core components which are as many datasets from the Eurostat official database:
1. **Gross Value Added (GVA)** in the ICT sector.
2. **Labour Demand (LD)** in the ICT sector. 
3. **Employment Rate (ER)** in ICT.

The DTPI offers a clear, data-driven snapshot of how digital investments are impacting economic growth, innovation, and the labor market, hence the potential measure intended and potential impact. More on the details and specific methodology can be found in the __Methodology__ section.
