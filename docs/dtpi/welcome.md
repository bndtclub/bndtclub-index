## Welcome to the Digital Transformation Potential Index (DTPI) Beta!

The DTPI, developed by the [Business and Digital Transformation Club at GSoM POLIMI](https://bit.ly/bndtclub), is a dynamic tool that provides quarterly insights into the digitalization trends across the European Union. It helps stakeholders like policymakers, businesses, and researchers understand the digital economy's current state and potential.

Focusing on three core components—Gross Value Added (GVA) in the ICT sector, labor demand, and employment in ICT—the DTPI offers a clear, data-driven snapshot of how digital investments are impacting economic growth, innovation, and the labor market.
